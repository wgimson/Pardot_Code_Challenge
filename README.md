# Pardot_Code_Challenge
Coding Challenge for Pardot

You can run this file in one of two ways. But first you probably want a windows machine with .NET framework 4 or above (I compiled it for 4), or Visual Studio installed on it...

1. Clone the repository and navigate to Pardot_Code_Challenge/bin/Debug in your command prompt and type `./Pardot_Code_Challenge <arg>`.You  must provide a numerical argument or you will get an error. Here is a screenshot of me doing this...

2. Alternatively you could open `Pardot_Code_Challenge.sln` in Visual Studio, build the project and run it by navigating to `Project Properties > Debug > Start Options > Command line arguments` and providing your argument there. Here is a screenshot of me doing that...

Also, if you want to see the prime numbers list generated you can uncomment the code show below in Main.cs...
